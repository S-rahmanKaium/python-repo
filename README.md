# Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Python Learning Repository**! This repository contains a collection of scripts, exercises, and small projects that I have worked on during my journey learning the Python programming language. It serves as a personal sandbox to practice coding, understand concepts, and gradually build confidence in Python programming.

## About This Repository

Learning to code is a process, and this repo captures my progress as I explore Python fundamentals and beyond. It includes code snippets, sample programs, and practice files that cover a variety of topics such as:

- Basic syntax and operations
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modules
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Object-oriented programming basics
- Simple algorithms and problem-solving exercises

Each file represents an experiment or lesson inspired by tutorials, books, online courses, and hands-on challenges. I regularly update the repository as I learn new concepts or revisit topics to deepen my understanding.
